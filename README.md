# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview

This project is a basic struture for an interactive page for users to create a profile and post pictures and descriptions about what the images represent.

**Technologies**

The technologies implemented in this project are First HTML and CSS coding organized using a Flat File BEM Structure. Within the CSS styles, declarations such as grid-templates-areas help to structure the main content by reducing and expanding the amount of rows and columns contained according to the screen width utilized to access the content. There are also several media queries implented at specific breakpoints to keep the page elements from conflicting as the page shrinks in width.
